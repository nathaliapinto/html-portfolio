        <p> I am a motivated and dedicated individual starting a new professional path in Finland.
            Currently enrolled in a Programming course at Sasky Vocational School. I am keen to secure
            a trainee role where I can apply my skills, gain valuable hands-on experience, and contribute
            to the success of the organization.</p>

        <h2>Personal Skills</h2>

        <ul>
            <p> I developed a strong passion for programming and began studying it independently in 2022. 
                I started with an Introduction to Programming course on the MOOC.fi platform, where I 
                learned the basics of Python. To deepen my knowledge, I joined the Digi-Duunipaja program at 
                Tredu in March 2023, which significantly enhanced my ICT skills. In October 2023, I was accepted 
                into a course at Sasky where I am also learning C#. Additionally, I am enthusiastic about web 
                development and have been advancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                
                <br></br>
                II am a fast learner who thrives both in team settings and when working independently.
                 I am sociable and easily connect with others. </p>
